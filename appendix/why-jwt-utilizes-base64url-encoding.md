# Why JWT Utilizes Base64URL Encoding
Both Base64 and Base64URL are ways to encode binary data in string form. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) utilize Base64 URL encoding for several reasons, each contributing to its effectiveness and compatibility in web environments.

## Compatibility

Base64 URL encoding's reliance on ASCII characters ensures JWTs can be transmitted and understood across diverse systems and technologies, enhancing interoperability in decentralized systems or between different programming languages.

**Example**: A system using JWTs for authentication between a JavaScript frontend and a Python backend benefits from Base64 URL encoding, as both environments can easily encode and decode the tokens without losing data or requiring additional handling.

## URL and Filename Safe

Unlike standard Base64, Base64 URL encoding is designed to be safe for use in URLs and filenames. It replaces `+` with `-` and `/` with `_`, avoiding issues with URL encoding and ensuring the JWT can be transmitted in web environments without modification.

**Example**: A JWT part encoded with standard Base64 might look like `T+J/9g==`. In Base64 URL encoding, it becomes `T-J_9g`, which is safe to include in a URL: `https://example.com/api?token=T-J_9g`.

## Avoiding Padding Issues

Base64 encoding employs the padding characters `=` to ensure that the resulting encoded output has a length that is a multiple of 4. It's important to note that the `=` padding characters themselves have no relation to the original data being encoded. 

But, Base64 URL encoding omits the padding characters to avoid complications in transmission where padding characters might be misinterpreted or stripped, potentially corrupting the token.

**Example**: A padded Base64-encoded JWT part might be `T-J_9g==`. Removing the padding for URL usage yields `T-J_9g`, still perfectly decodable but without the risk of padding issues in transit.
